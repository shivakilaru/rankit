Step 6: A browswer window should pop-up with the start-page (if it
	doesn't click "Open Start Page" in MAMP)
Step 7: Click phpMyAdmin tab at the top of the webpage
Step 8: Click the "Databases" tab
Step 9: In the "Create database" field enter RankIt (must have
	capital 'R' and 'I') and click "Create"
Step 10: Go to the finder directory for rankit inside your
	MAMP application (this is the folder you copied into htdocs)
Step 11: Open db.php
Step 12: Comment out this line:
	$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=sql100.byethost8.com;dbname=b8_13744073_RankIt', 'b8_13744073', '711442');
Step 13: Uncomment this line:
	$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;port=8889;dbname=RankIt','root','root');
Step 14: Open rankit.sql and copy its contents
Step 15: Go back into phpMyAdmin, click Rankit under databases

You should be all set!

Now you should be able to complete a rankit and view the results in
phpMyAdmin by clicking on the rankIt table and clicking Browse :)
